# Four-color-Therorem-application

The four-color theorem states that any map in a plane can be colored using four-colors in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same color. This problem is sometimes also called Guthrie's problem after F. Guthrie, who first conjectured the theorem in 1852.

This project provide both greedy and backtrack algorithms based on the four color theorem and there application on Morocco and Africa Maps.
